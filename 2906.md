[`r-ci.yml`] has [been failing][r-ci.yml main] on `main` [since mid-June][r-ci.yml main pg4].

- The first 4 failures ([#5418], [#5419], [#5422], [#5423]; Jun 17-18) began with [#2732]
- [#5426] and [#5427] then passed (Jun 19-20)
- Since [#5442] (Jun 28), all 81 runs have failed (as of 2024-08-26T09:01:06Z: [#14](https://github.com/ryan-williams/tdbs-r-ci-dbg/actions/runs/10556837816))


## Example output
The last output is typically `70 | ScalarMap`, before a segfault:

```
✔ |         70 | ScalarMap

```

The segfault messages vary; `memory not mapped`, `bad_function_call`, `invalid permissions`, `address (nil), cause 'unknown'`. [ryan-williams/tdbs-r-ci-dbg] contains some analysis of the logs of failing runs, including frequencies of various error messages.

## Occasional successful runs
A few runs have passed on PR branches (e.g. [1][success 1], [2][success 2]). However, I tried re-running the first one, and [it failed][re-run fail], so it seems like it's just non-deterministic, and usually fails. The `dark/images` branch did [pass 3x in a row][dark/images], 8/8-11.

## Plan for debugging / fixing?
Several folks on the team have made some progress debugging it, but a fix remains elusive.

From discussions with @johnkerl, ongoing work to remove our dependency on [TileDB-R] may resolve it.

## Change workflow to 24hr cron?
It's been causing "spurious" ❌'s on PRs (and `main`) for 2 months, which can mask other failures.

Disabling it altogether feels too aggressive; it's good to have some visibility into the state of the R tests.

Setting it to run against `main` every 24hrs might be a good compromise.
